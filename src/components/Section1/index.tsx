          Potatoes were introduced to Europe from the Americas by the Spanish in
          the second half of the 16th century. Today they are a staple food in
          many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's
          food supply. As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food
          crop.
